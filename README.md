# dotfiles
Configurations for dotfiles like vimrc, zshrc, as well as my terminal settings.

Assumes https://ohmyz.sh/ is installed (with a modified terminalparty theme)

For personal reference, since my Mac partition failed on 19 March 2019, but all are free to use and modify my settings (:

Tomorrow theme colors are from https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme
